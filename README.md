MoDiCo
======

MoDiCo is a framework for Distributed Computing on Mobile Devices in an Ad Hoc Network. It shall provide a starting point to develop distributed applications to (pre)process data in a mobile environment. 
The focus lies on supporting mobile platforms, optimizing power usage and building robust ad hoc networks of locally available devices.

What is the point?
------------------
Sensor networks or research groups on the field might need to preprocess data before delivering it to the sink. The limited capacity and power supply of mobile devices require a different approach to optimize the processing of data. Additionally, a computing network of that kind must accept failures and disconnection while still providing reliable results.
